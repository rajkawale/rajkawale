## The Challenge

Most writing tools focus on surface-level grammar and spelling. Technical and academic writing requires deeper understanding of structure, precision, tone, and intent, which generic spell-checkers fail to address.

## The Solution

**Context-aware Precision Editing:**
Designed rules and prompts tuned for formal, technical, and academic writing structures rather than casual language.

**Focused UX/UI Prototype:**
Built an interface optimized for dense content, enabling users to review and refine complex text without cognitive overload.
