## The Problem

Customer data was fragmented across multiple systems, creating poor targeting accuracy and unclear ROI. This was a business and decision-making problem at scale, where marketing teams couldn't confidently allocate budget or measure campaign effectiveness.

## My Role & Scope

Owned discovery and product definition for the unified customer data platform. Emphasized cross-functional collaboration with engineering, data, and business teams. Operated within enterprise constraints and scale, balancing technical feasibility with business impact.

## Key Product Decisions

* **Prioritized high-impact signals over full data completeness:** Focused on the most valuable customer signals that drove targeting decisions, rather than attempting to unify all data sources.

* **Chose incremental rollout over large migrations:** Deployed the platform incrementally to reduce risk and build trust, rather than attempting a complete system overhaul.

* **Balanced sophistication with explainability for trust:** Ensured the platform's recommendations were transparent and understandable to business stakeholders, not just technically accurate.

## Execution Highlights

Defined customer data models and ingestion strategy. Partnered with platform and data teams to build scalable infrastructure. Enabled downstream targeting and measurement use cases that directly improved campaign performance.

## Outcomes

* +23% ROI impact on enterprise campaigns
* Improved targeting accuracy and decision confidence
* Scalable foundation for future personalization

## Key Learnings

* Enterprise progress depends on alignment across teams and stakeholders
* Problem framing beats feature breadth in driving adoption
* Adoption and trust are critical success factors in enterprise product work
