## The Problem

Farmers lacked direct access to demand and fair pricing. Buyers (hotels/restaurants) faced inconsistent quality, pricing, and supply. Middlemen captured most of the margin while adding limited value. The core challenge was aligning supply, demand, logistics, and pricing at scale.

## The Business Model

Direct-to-business (D2C/B2B hybrid) model eliminating middlemen. Commission-based revenue model with focus on predictable demand from bulk buyers. Margin discipline as a first-class constraint.

## Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

* **Prioritized demand certainty over rapid expansion:** Secured committed buyers before scaling supply, ensuring sustainable unit economics.

* **Built logistics manually before investing in automation:** Validated processes and unit economics through hands-on operations before technology investment.

* **Focused on unit economics before geographic scale:** Proved profitability in one market before expanding to new regions.

* **Accepted operational complexity to protect farmer margins:** Chose manual coordination over automation to ensure farmers received fair pricing and buyers got reliable supply.

## Execution & Operations

Designed end-to-end supply chain from farms to urban buyers. Led day-to-day logistics, fulfillment, and vendor coordination. Built internal tooling and processes to manage orders and delivery. Led an 8-member cross-functional team across operations, sales, and logistics.

## Outcomes

* ₹8L revenue generated within the first year
* 20–25% contribution margin achieved
* Sustainable unit economics validated
* Repeat demand from bulk buyers

## Key Learnings

* Supply chain reliability matters more than pricing in B2B food
* Margins are protected through process discipline, not scale alone
* Trust on both sides (farmers and buyers) compounds over time
* Execution quality is a competitive advantage in physical marketplaces
