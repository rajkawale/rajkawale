## The Problem

Farmers lacked direct access to predictable demand and fair pricing. Bulk buyers such as hotels and restaurants faced inconsistent quality, unreliable supply, and volatile pricing. Middlemen captured a disproportionate share of value while adding limited operational efficiency.

The core challenge was aligning supply, demand, logistics, and pricing in a repeatable and economically viable way.

## The Business Model

Direct-to-business marketplace eliminating traditional intermediaries. Commission-based revenue model anchored on predictable demand from bulk buyers. Unit economics and margin discipline treated as first-class constraints from day one.

## Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

**Prioritized demand certainty over rapid expansion:**
Secured committed buyers before onboarding large farmer supply to protect utilization and margins.

**Built logistics manually before automation:**
Operated the supply chain hands-on to validate workflows and unit economics before investing in technology.

**Focused on unit economics before geographic scale:**
Proved profitability and operational repeatability in a single market before considering expansion.

**Accepted operational complexity to protect farmer margins:**
Chose manual coordination and tighter control over automation to ensure fair farmer payouts and reliable buyer fulfillment.

## Execution & Operations

Designed and operated the end-to-end supply chain from farms to urban buyers. Owned daily logistics, procurement, fulfillment, and pricing decisions. Built internal processes and lightweight tools to manage orders and deliveries. Led an 8-member cross-functional team across operations, sales, and logistics.

## Outcomes

*   ₹8L revenue generated within the first year
*   20–25% contribution margin achieved
*   Sustainable unit economics validated
*   Repeat demand secured from bulk buyers

## Key Learnings

*   Supply chain reliability matters more than pricing in B2B food markets
*   Margins are protected through process discipline, not scale alone
*   Trust with both farmers and buyers compounds over time
*   Execution quality is a durable competitive advantage in physical marketplaces
