## The Context

Pernia’s Pop-Up Shop is a luxury fashion ecommerce platform serving 500+ designers and handling ₹1Cr+ in daily revenue. As traffic and catalog scale increased, platform performance, checkout reliability, and seller onboarding became key constraints to growth.

## The Problem

The cart and checkout experience was built on a tightly coupled monolith, leading to extreme load times, failed transactions, and poor conversion. Additionally, onboarding new designers was operationally heavy, slowing marketplace expansion.

## My Role & Scope

Owned product discovery and execution across core ecommerce flows including homepage merchandising, cart, checkout, and seller onboarding. Worked closely with engineering, design, and business teams to balance performance, reliability, and revenue growth at enterprise scale.

## Key Product & Technical Decisions

**Decoupled cart from the monolith into microservices:**
Prioritized cart reliability and performance as the highest-leverage conversion surface.

**Focused on performance before new feature expansion:**
Addressed load time and failure rates before adding incremental UX enhancements.

**Built self-serve workflows to replace manual operations:**
Reduced dependency on internal teams while accelerating marketplace supply growth.

## Execution Highlights

Led the migration of cart functionality from a monolith to a microservices architecture, reducing load times from 50s to 1s. Improved checkout reliability and reduced friction across homepage, PDP, and transaction flows for 1L+ daily visitors.

Launched a self-serve vendor onboarding portal, cutting onboarding time by 70% for 500+ designers. Redesigned localized homepages using data-driven merchandising logic to improve engagement and discovery.

## Outcomes

*   Cart load time reduced from 50s to 1s
*   +26% CTR and +54% increase in session duration
*   Daily revenue scaled from ₹70L+ to ₹1Cr+
*   70% reduction in designer onboarding time

## Key Learnings

*   Performance is a growth lever, not just an engineering concern
*   Reliability compounds revenue in high-scale ecommerce systems
*   Platform investments unlock both customer and seller-side growth
*   PMs create leverage by fixing core constraints before layering features
