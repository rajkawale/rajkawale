## The Problem

Users seeking mental health support often do not know what kind of help they need. Traditional therapy requires multiple sessions before patterns emerge, and most AI chatbots stop at surface-level empathy without helping users understand recurring thinking or emotional patterns.

RaiTalk exists to accelerate self-awareness and insight, not to replace therapy.

## The Vision

RaiTalk focuses on pattern awareness through guided self-reflection. Instead of giving advice or diagnoses, it helps users reach their own realizations by identifying thinking patterns and emotional triggers through natural conversation.

## Key Product Decisions

**Reflection over advice:**
Users engage more deeply when the system helps them arrive at conclusions themselves rather than prescribing answers.

**Conversation-first UX over structured questionnaires:**
Early structure reduces emotional honesty. Natural conversation surfaces more authentic patterns.

**Session-based memory over long-term profiling:**
Prioritizes privacy and trust while reducing the feeling of being tracked or judged across sessions.

## The Engineering

**Cognitive Pattern Recognition:**
Maps user inputs to established psychological frameworks to surface recurring thinking patterns and emotional triggers.

**Session-level Emotional State Tracking:**
Tracks mood progression within a session to guide reflective prompts and follow-up questions.

**Insight-led Conversation Flow:**
Structures conversations to guide users toward self-realization rather than prescriptive responses.
