## The Vision

Standard AI chatbots offer sympathy. RaiTalk offers **Analysis**. It acts as an advanced psychologist, reading between the lines to identify thinking patterns, emotional triggers, and cognitive distortions.

## The Engineering

* **Cognitive Pattern Recognition:** Utilizing DeepSeek to map user inputs against psychological frameworks (CBT/DBT/RBET/Person Centered).

* **Emotional State Tracking:** A session-based memory that tracks the trajectory of a user's mood over time.

* **Data-Driven Therapy:** It doesn't just "talk"; it structures the conversation to lead the user to their own realization.
